# SFML Setup and Execution

## Introduction
SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) is a powerful multimedia library written in C++ that provides various features for creating interactive applications and games. This guide will walk you through the steps to set up SFML and run an SFML project.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

CMake: A cross-platform build system (version 3.0 or higher).
SFML Library: The SFML library itself, which can be obtained from the official SFML website.

## Setup Instructions
Clone the cmake-sfml-project-master repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the root directory of the cmake-sfml-project-master repository.
Open the README.md file for further instructions specific to the project.

## Running the SFML code
Once you have followed the setup instructions mentioned in the README.md file, you are ready to build the project.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the cmake-sfml-project-master/build directory.
Run the following command to build the project:
./CMakeSFMLProject

Congratulations! You have successfully set up and executed an SFML project. You can now explore the capabilities of SFML and develop your own interactive applications and games.#
